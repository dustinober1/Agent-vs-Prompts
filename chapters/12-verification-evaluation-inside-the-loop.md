# Chapter 12 — Verification: evaluation inside the loop

## Purpose
Replace “sounds right” with “passes checks.”

## Reader takeaway
Agents become reliable when they can prove constraints (format, factuality, alignment) via checks that live outside the model.

## Key points
- Why self-checks aren’t enough
- Verification layers: schema, deterministic checks, cross-validation, second-model critique, human review
- Evaluators: rubric-based, test-case based, property-based

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Checks: citation resolvability, claim traceability, plagiarism/duplication, redaction/classification

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Checks: alignment rubric, accessibility checks, time estimates, policy version correctness

## Artifacts to produce
- Eval suites for both case studies (rubrics + golden sets + properties)

## Chapter exercise
Define eval suites for both case studies (factuality, tone, structure, safety, alignment).

## Notes / references
- TODO: define “stop-ship” thresholds for eval failures later used in ops chapters
