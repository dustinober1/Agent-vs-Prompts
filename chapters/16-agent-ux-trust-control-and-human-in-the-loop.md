# Chapter 16 — Agent UX: trust, control, and human-in-the-loop

## Purpose
Make agents usable and safe for real users.

## Reader takeaway
Trust comes from previews, sources, approvals, undo, and audit logs—especially when agents can take actions.

## Key points
- Trust: previews/confirmations, visible sources, explainable next steps, undo/audits
- Human-in-the-loop: approval gates, review queues, clarification questions
- UX anti-patterns: black-box autopilot, overconfidence, irreversible actions

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- UX gates: approve outline, approve sources, approve final brief before publish/share
- Show: claim-to-source map and redaction summary

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- UX gates: confirm learner constraints, approve objectives, approve assessments before scenarios, final compliance sign-off before export
- Show: alignment rubric results and accessibility checklist

## Artifacts to produce
- Approval flows and UI copy for key confirmations

## Chapter exercise
Design an approval flow for a tool that can publish a draft (CMS/repo) or push a lesson into an LMS.

## Notes / references
- TODO: add a “confidence language” style guide (avoid overclaiming)
