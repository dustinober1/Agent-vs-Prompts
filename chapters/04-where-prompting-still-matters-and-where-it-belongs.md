# Chapter 4 — Where prompting still matters (and where it belongs)

## Purpose
Avoid false dichotomies; keep what works.

## Reader takeaway
Prompts still matter for instruction scaffolding and formatting, but rules, security, and evaluation belong outside the prompt.

## Key points
- Prompting as scaffolding, tool hints, formatting constraints, voice guidelines
- Keep business rules, authorization, data access controls, eval criteria, retries outside the prompt
- Prompt engineering becomes prompt design + testing + versioning

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Keep prompts focused on structure/tone
- Enforce citations, traceability, and redaction via tools + validators

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Keep prompts focused on clarity and style for learners
- Enforce policy mapping, alignment rubric, accessibility checks, and approvals outside the prompt

## Artifacts to produce
- A “prompt surface area budget” for each agent (what must be in prompt vs in tools/config/policy)

## Chapter exercise
Create a “prompt surface area” budget for each case study (what must be in prompt vs code/config).

## Notes / references
- TODO: add examples of good “small prompts” that sit inside a larger system
