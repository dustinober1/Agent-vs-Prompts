# Chapter 6 — Degrees of agency: when to use what

## Purpose
Prevent over-agenting; introduce a decision framework.

## Reader takeaway
Use the minimum viable agency that achieves reliability; escalate to agents only when task stakes and uncertainty demand it.

## Key points
- Ladder: template → few-shot → structured output + validation → RAG → tool use → plan-and-execute → routed/multi-agent
- Criteria: uncertainty, stakes, freshness needs, side effects, latency/cost, ground-truth availability

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Why simple prompting fails: freshness + grounding + confidentiality
- Where to land on the ladder: RAG + tool use + verification loop

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Why simple prompting fails: alignment + policy accuracy + audit requirements
- Where to land on the ladder: tool-assisted workflow with validators + approvals

## Artifacts to produce
- A “minimum viable agency” decision for each case study (with rationale)

## Chapter exercise
Score both case studies (and 3 of your own features) on the ladder and pick the minimum viable agency.

## Notes / references
- TODO: define budget constraints (time/tokens/tool calls) you’ll use later
