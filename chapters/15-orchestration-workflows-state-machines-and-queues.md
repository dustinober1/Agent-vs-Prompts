# Chapter 15 — Orchestration: workflows, state machines, and queues

## Purpose
Translate agent behavior into reliable software.

## Reader takeaway
Orchestration turns “agent magic” into dependable execution via explicit states, transitions, timeouts, and recoverable failures.

## Key points
- Workflow vs agent: when to lock steps vs allow autonomy
- Primitives: state machines, event triggers, queues/jobs, concurrency limits, cancellation/timeouts
- Artifact management for reproducibility

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Orchestrate: research → extract → outline → draft → verify → revise
- Persist artifacts: source list, quote library, claim map, drafts

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Orchestrate: policy mapping → objectives → assessments → scenarios → QA checks → approvals → LMS export
- Persist artifacts: mapping tables, question bank, approval log, export package

## Artifacts to produce
- Orchestration diagrams for both case studies (states, transitions, failure paths)

## Chapter exercise
Draw an orchestration diagram for an agent feature (states, transitions, failure paths).

## Notes / references
- TODO: define rollback/undo semantics for exports/publishing
