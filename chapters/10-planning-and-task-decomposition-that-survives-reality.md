# Chapter 10 — Planning and task decomposition that survives reality

## Purpose
Make plans useful, adaptable, and testable.

## Reader takeaway
Plans should be explicit artifacts with checkpoints and measurable completion criteria, not just prose lists.

## Key points
- Plans as artifacts: milestones, dependencies, measurable criteria
- Approaches: single-shot, rolling-wave replanning, hierarchical plans
- Uncertainty: exploration steps, branching/backtracking, budget-aware planning

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Decompose into: clarify → research plan → gather → extract → outline → draft → verify → revise
- Add checkpoints: “sources collected”, “quotes extracted”, “claim map complete”

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Decompose into: clarify → objectives + policies/SOPs → assessment plan → scenarios → accessibility/localization → alignment QA
- Add checkpoints: “objective-policy map”, “assessment coverage”, “approval-ready package”

## Artifacts to produce
- Task graphs for each case study (with checkpoints and fail-fast tests)

## Chapter exercise
Convert a vague request (“write about X” or “design training for role Y”) into a task graph with checkpoints and fail-fast tests.

## Notes / references
- TODO: define what the agent stores as artifacts between steps (outline, notes, maps)
