# Chapter 5 — Prompts are interface; agents are systems

## Purpose
Define the mental model shift from text to systems engineering.

## Reader takeaway
Treat the model as a reasoning module inside a system with boundaries, state, observability, and invariants.

## Key points
- Systems thinking: inputs, outputs, constraints, state transitions, observability, invariants
- Tasks (intent) vs actions (tools) vs artifacts (outputs)
- “Make the environment do the work”: store facts externally, compute with tools, verify with tests

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Draw the boundary: model writes; tools retrieve; validators verify citations and redaction
- Identify invariants: every claim must map to a source; no confidential leakage

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Draw the boundary: model drafts; tools pull policy; checks enforce alignment/accessibility; humans approve
- Identify invariants: objectives assessed; policies current; audit trail maintained

## Artifacts to produce
- System boundary diagrams for both case studies

## Chapter exercise
Draw the system boundary for both case studies (what’s inside/outside the model).

## Notes / references
- TODO: define a minimal “agent spec” format used in later chapters
