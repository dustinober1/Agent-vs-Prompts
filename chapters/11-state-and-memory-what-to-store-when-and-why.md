# Chapter 11 — State and memory: what to store, when, and why

## Purpose
Separate short-term reasoning from long-term knowledge and user context.

## Reader takeaway
State and memory are product and policy decisions: what to store, what to forget, and what requires explicit consent.

## Key points
- State: conversation, task, tool, artifact
- Memory: ephemeral, session, long-term preferences (consent), organizational knowledge
- Policies: retention, redaction/PII, write triggers, retrieval triggers

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Remember: voice/house style + previously approved phrasing patterns
- Do not remember: confidential policy details beyond what user provided/approved

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Remember: role context, constraints, brand/compliance requirements (with consent)
- Do not remember: sensitive incident details or internal-only examples unless explicitly approved

## Artifacts to produce
- Memory rubric for each case study (allowed vs forbidden memory + retention)

## Chapter exercise
Create a “memory rubric” for both case studies (what the agent is allowed to remember).

## Notes / references
- TODO: define a “memory write gate” (what signals allow persisting a fact)
