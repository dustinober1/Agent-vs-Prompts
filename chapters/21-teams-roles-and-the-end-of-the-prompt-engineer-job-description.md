# Chapter 21 — Teams, roles, and the end of the “prompt engineer” job description

## Purpose
Translate the technical shift into an organizational one.

## Reader takeaway
Agentic systems require ownership of tools, evals, reliability, and policy—prompting becomes one part of a broader engineering discipline.

## Key points
- Roles: agent/product engineer, evaluator, reliability/LLMOps, domain experts (policy/compliance)
- Workflow: artifact-based collaboration; version everything (prompts, tools, policies, datasets)
- Career transition: from prompt tricks to systems, APIs, and measurement

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- Ownership map: who owns sources, citation policy, redaction rules, and publication approvals

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- Ownership map: L&D owns pedagogy; Security/Legal own policy; Ops owns LMS exports and audit

## Artifacts to produce
- A RACI matrix for each agent and a “definition of done” checklist

## Chapter exercise
Map your org’s responsibilities to roles and identify missing ownership.

## Notes / references
- TODO: include an example “agent change request” process (prompt/tool/eval updates together)
