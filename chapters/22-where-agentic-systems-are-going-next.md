# Chapter 22 — Where agentic systems are going next

## Purpose
Close with a realistic future-facing view.

## Reader takeaway
Expect better tool use and stronger evaluation norms; the hard parts remain intent alignment, security, and long-horizon reliability.

## Key points
- Trends: better tool reasoning, multimodal agents, private execution, standardized evals, regulation/audit defaults
- What stays hard: intent alignment, long-horizon reliability, security, grounding in messy data
- Closing framework: tools + contracts, evals + observability, security + governance

## Case study thread
### Research+Write (Policy change brief)
- What improves: higher-quality grounding + structured citations
- What stays hard: policy ambiguity, confidentiality, injection resilience

### Instructional Design (Annual compliance training)
- What improves: better alignment checks and accessibility tooling
- What stays hard: measuring real behavior change and keeping training current across org change

## Artifacts to produce
- A “next bets” roadmap for iterating on the two agents

## Chapter exercise
TODO: write a 1-page roadmap for extending one of the case studies over 6 months (capabilities, evals, and guardrails).

## Notes / references
- TODO: add a short glossary refresh and recommended learning path
